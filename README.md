**a homemade, dynamically-typed programming language** ðŸ’—

if you know me (and my github profile picture), you know I'm a corgi fanatic! And I also love expanding my knowledge in all things coding. I thought it would be super cool to try my hand at decoding all the magic that goes on under the hood in some of my favourite programming languages. So, what better way to do this then smush my love for corgis and learning about development together and embark on the journey of creating my own language?

*Java AND C++ compatible cause I like:*

1. pain
2. completeness and doing stuff a bunch of different ways and comparing and constrasting them
3. making my life extremely difficult in any way possible
4. spending more time on this so I can listen to as much Panic! At the Disco while I code as possible
5. practicing and expanding my knowledge in the 2 main languages that I'm in progress of becoming proficient in 

Documentation coming soon ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©
