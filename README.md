**a homemade, dynamically-typed programming language** ðŸ’—

if you know me (and my github profile picture), you know I'm a corgi fanatic! And I also love expanding my knowledge in all things coding. I thought it would be super cool to try my hand at decoding all the magic that goes on under the hood in some of my favourite programming languages. So, what better way to do this then smush my love for corgis and learning about development together and embark on the journey of creating my own language?

*Java AND C++ compatible* !

Documentation coming soon ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©ðŸ˜©
